    <h1>Newsletter Swap Document: How to use NL swaps</h1>
    <strong>What is a newsletter swap?</strong>
    <p>A newsletter swap is where I will share a link to your book in my newsletter and vice versa (you include my book in one of your newsletters).</p>

    <p>Example:<br>
    You and John each have 1,000 subscribers on your respective mailing lists.<br>
    John has agreed to share the link to your book in his newsletter 1 week from now to his 1,000 subscribers.<br>
    In exchange, you agree to include a link to John's book in your newsletter in 2 weeks.<br>
    In the example above, you've doubled your reach from 1,000 to 2,000 subscribers, since John is sharing your book with his audience (and you can share your book with your own audience).<br>
    Even better, the extra reach is free!<br>
    Author Verse makes it really easy to find other authors looking for newsletter swaps.</p>

    <h2>How do I “do” a newsletter swap?</h2>
    <p>Newsletter swaps are great, because you don't need to figure out any complicated ads dashboard, etc.<br>
    Include the link to the author's book in your newsletter and you're done.<br>
    The first section of the newsletter usually includes personal updates, general interest items, etc.<br>
    The second section (“Other Books You Might Like”) includes books from newsletter swaps.</p>

    <p>Just drop the book cover in your newsletter and embed the link (optionally, include a blurb or the price).<br>
    Embed the link in the book cover image so that clicking the book cover will take you directly to a landing page for that particular book.</p>

    <p>How do I include images and links in my newsletter like the example?<br>
    Email service providers make it easy to drop images in your newsletter and embed links.<br>
    1) Download the book cover by right-clicking the image in your browser and hitting “save as...”<br>
    2) Go to your newsletter designer / sender (e.g. MailChimp, MailerLite, SendFox, etc.)<br>
    3) Create a block in your newsletter for images (Here are support articles from MailChimp and MailerLite)<br>
    4) Upload the book cover to that block<br>
    5) Select the image block, and update the “link” field with the book's link</p>

    <p>If you're using Author Verse for arranging newsletter swaps, you will receive a special Tracking Link for the swap that you should use.<br>
    Tracking Links are important because they tell the author you swapped with how many clicks their book got, so they know you upheld your end.<br>
    Tracking Links (and how to find them) are covered later in this guide, so just keep reading.</p>

    <h2>What if my mailing list is still really small or I don't have one?</h2>
    <p>You do need to have a mailing list in order to run newsletter swaps, but it doesn't matter how large it is. (It could even just be your own email on it!)<br>
    Many authors get started with newsletter swaps when their lists are small.<br>
    Many authors feel some anxiety about sending out their first (or even 50th) newsletter, and making those commitments to other authors is a great way to push yourself forward.<br>

    It's like having an accountability buddy encouraging you to send out a newsletter.</p>

    <p>Newsletter swaps are more effective when your list gets larger and you can swap with other authors with similarly large audiences.<br>
    So, you'll want to grow your list quickly (here's a guide for going from 0 to 1,000+ subscribers), but having a small list shouldn't stop you</p>


    <h2>Should I Share My Email List with Other Authors?</h2>

<p>This is a common point of confusion among authors that have never done newsletter swaps before. With a newsletter swap, you do not share your subscribers' email addresses with anyone. A newsletter swap only requires that you share a link to the other author's book in one of your newsletters. That's all it is.</p>

<h3>Do I Need to Read Every Book I Mention in My Newsletter?</h3>

<p>No, you don't need to read every single book that you agree to a newsletter swap for. That's why I define a newsletter swap as agreeing to “mention” a book (not “recommend”). When you put your newsletter together, I recommend having a section titled something like “Other books that might interest you.” This wording makes it clear that it's up to the reader to check the books out for themselves to see if they might be interested. This section of your newsletter is like the “also bought” section on Amazon. In the “also bought” section, Amazon shows you other books that might interest you based on the book you're currently looking at. Amazon isn't saying they've read and recommended those books. They're just books in the same or similar genre.</p>

<h3>Can I Only Agree to One Swap for Each Newsletter I Send?</h3>

<p>You can agree to one or multiple newsletter swaps for each newsletter you send. For example, let's say you agree to newsletter swaps with 3 different authors for your campaign 2 weeks from now, and you each have 1,000 subscribers on your respective mailing lists. Each of the other authors will promote your book to their 1,000 subscribers on whatever dates they send their newsletters. In total, your book would be promoted to 4,000 subscribers (each author promoting your book to their 1,000 subscribers plus your own list). In turn, you will mention all 3 books (1 for each newsletter swap) in your newsletter 2 weeks from now. You only have to send a single newsletter, and you've effectively quadrupled your reach!</p>

<h3>Is There a Maximum Number of Newsletter Swaps I Can Include in My Newsletter?</h3>

<p>I recommend limiting yourself to a maximum of 6 newsletter swaps for each newsletter you send out. The balancing act is to make sure that you're sending each book a decent number of clicks. On Author Verse, swaps are completely transparent. Every author you request to swap with can see how many clicks you sent to past newsletter swaps. So, if you jam your newsletter with too many books, you're only going to get a handful of clicks on each one, and other authors will likely stop accepting any swap requests you send.</p>
