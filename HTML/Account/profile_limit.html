    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p>StoryOrigin is 1 pen name per account; thus you should set up another account if you'd like to use another pen name with StoryOrigin.</p>

        <p>If you have an account for each of your pen names on StoryOrigin, and you're worried about the cost of upgrading each of your accounts, here's the (very good) deal.</p>
        
      <p>  If you upgrade with the yearly billing option on 1 account, you will get a 50% lifetime discount on the yearly option for any additional accounts you set up for other pen names that you write under.</p>
        
        <p>The quick math: $100 / year (for the first account) + $50 / year (for each additional account).</p>
        
      <p>  When it comes time, you should email us before you upgrade your 2nd or 3rd account and provide some verification to get this discount at checkout.</p>

        <h2>Why is there a limit?</h2>
        <p>Originally, you could set up multiple author profiles per account, but that model has a few issues.</p>

    <p> Complexity. When transitioning to 1 pen name per account, the authors who had their accounts split up actually liked it, because it was easier for them to keep the context straight when applying for cross-promos.</p>
<p>    Complexity. Adding new features becomes exponentially more difficult, as the system must account for which book/link/group promo/newsletter/etc. is associated with which author profile, so that neither you nor StoryOrigin accidentally reveal anonymous info.</p>
<p>        Complexity. While having everything together in 1 account would maybe make it easier for the small percentage of authors with multiple pen names (though not necessarily, see the 2nd point), the vast majority of authors would have to suffer a much more complex UI than they needed.</p>
